# NNwithFraudTransactions
Neural Net with [Fraudulent Transactions Data]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitwanmanchanda/fraudulent-transactions-data?resource=download))

Initial goal is to get a model with recall of 0.9 or more and precision of 0.5 or more.

### Want to do (in no particular order)
- [ ] Use older transactions of client as model input
- [ ] Try different loss functions
- [x] Try undersampling
- [ ] Additional feature engineering
- [x] Deeper models
- [ ] Threshold the performance against other models (random forrest?) and other solutions.
